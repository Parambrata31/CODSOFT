Spam SMS detection is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. The goal is to develop an AI model capable of accurately distinguishing between spam (unsolicited, often commercial) and legitimate SMS messages. This task is essential for enhancing user experience, security, and privacy in mobile communication.
