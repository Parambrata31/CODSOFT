Welcome to the Virtual Internship in Machine Learning! This program is designed to provide with hands-on experience in various machine learning tasks, including Movie Genre Classification, Spam SMS Detection, and Customer Churn Prediction. In this internship, I worked on real-world sets, applied Machine Learning Algorithms and gained valuable insights into the field of Machine Learning and Python. 
For Movie Genre Classification, task was to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the genre(s) of a movie based on its plot summary, and i worked with NLP and classification algorithm like Naive-Bayes and various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, and developed a model that will classify a movie belonging to which genre.
